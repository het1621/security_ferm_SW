Draft → Pending Approval → Posted (Approved) → Cannot be Modified
                               ↓
                          Cancelled (with reason recorded)
```

- **Draft** — Created but not yet submitted
- **Pending Approval** — Submitted by accountant, waiting for admin/manager approval
- **Posted** — Approved and permanently recorded in the books
- **Cancelled** — Voided with a mandatory reason (maintains audit trail)

#### 📊 Voucher Dashboard Summary
At the top of the Vouchers page, you see real-time totals:
| Metric | What It Shows |
|--------|--------------|
| **Total Vouchers** | Number of vouchers created in the period |
| **Posted Amount** | Total value of approved transactions |
| **Pending Amount** | Value of vouchers awaiting approval |
| **Draft Amount** | Value of vouchers still being prepared |

#### 🔗 Automatic Numbering
- Each voucher type has its own **sequential counter**
- Format: `BR-2627-001` (Bank Receipt, FY 2026-27, Sequence 1)
- **Financial year aware** — counters reset at the start of each April

#### 🔍 Powerful Filters
- Filter by **voucher type**, **status**, **date range**, or **party**
- Sort by date, amount, or voucher number
- **Search by narration** — find any transaction by description

> [!TIP]
> **Real-World Scenario:** Your agency owner puts ₹2,00,000 of personal money into the business bank account. Without the Voucher system, this money would "appear from nowhere" and confuse your books. With a **Bank Receipt** voucher marked as party type "Other" with narration "Owner Capital Contribution", the Balance Sheet correctly shows it as increased Capital, and the bank balance updates accurately.

## 17. Bank Reconciliation — ⭐ NEW in v1.2.2

![Bank Reconciliation — Match software records against bank statements](C:/Users/ratan/.gemini/antigravity-ide/brain/5093639a-844a-4c48-91d8-f2d04448d5fd/bank_reconciliation_page_1783621645374.png)

### What You See Above
A **bank reconciliation tool** that ensures your software's records match your actual bank statement — the ultimate accuracy check for your finances.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Bank Reconciliation is the **proof of truth** in accounting. When your Balance Sheet says you have ₹5,00,000 in the bank, Bank Reconciliation **verifies** that this number matches reality by checking against your HDFC or SBI bank statement. Without it, errors go undetected and you cannot trust your own books.

### Features in Detail

#### 🏦 Multi-Account Support
- Reconcile **each bank account separately** (HDFC, SBI, Cash-in-Hand)
- Select any account from the dropdown to see its transactions
- Each account shows its own **running balance**

#### ✅ Reconciliation Workflow
The process is simple and intuitive:

1. **Download** your monthly bank statement PDF from HDFC/SBI
2. **Open** the Bank Reconciliation page in SecurManage
3. **Select** the bank account (e.g., "HDFC Current A/c")
4. **Compare** each voucher against the bank statement line-by-line
5. **Check the box** next to each transaction that matches
6. **Click "Reconcile Selected"** to permanently mark them as verified

#### 📊 Reconciliation Status
Each transaction shows one of these statuses:

| Status | Meaning | Color |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **✅ Reconciled** | Matches the bank statement — verified | Green |
| **⏳ Unreconciled** | In software but not yet verified against bank statement | Yellow |
| **⚠️ Discrepancy** | Amount in software differs from bank statement | Red |

#### 🔍 Why Transactions Don't Match (Common Scenarios)

| Scenario | What Happens |
|----------|-------------|
| **Cheque not yet cleared** | You recorded a Bank Receipt voucher for ₹45,000 on July 1, but the cheque clears in the bank on July 5. Until July 5, it appears as "Unreconciled". |
| **Bank charges** | The bank deducted ₹500 in maintenance fees. This appears in the bank statement but not in your software. You create a Bank Payment voucher and then reconcile it. |
| **Data entry error** | You typed ₹54,000 instead of ₹45,000. Reconciliation reveals the ₹9,000 discrepancy so you can correct it. |
| **Unauthorized transaction** | A transaction appears in the bank statement that nobody in your office created. Immediate red flag for investigation. |

#### 📊 Reconciliation Summary
At the top of each account's reconciliation view:
| Metric | Description |
|--------|------------|
| **Book Balance** | Balance according to your software |
| **Bank Balance** | Balance according to the bank statement |
| **Difference** | Any mismatch between the two |
| **Unreconciled Items** | Count of transactions still pending verification |

#### 📅 Date Range Filter
- Reconcile by **month**, **quarter**, or **custom date range**
- **Show/Hide reconciled** transactions to focus on pending items

> [!TIP]
> **Monthly Best Practice:** At the end of every month, have your accountant spend 15-20 minutes reconciling each bank account. This one habit catches 100% of data entry errors and provides complete peace of mind that your Balance Sheet is accurate.

![Developer Console — Hidden error monitoring with real-time tracking](C:/Users/ratan/.gemini/antigravity-ide/brain/5093639a-844a-4c48-91d8-f2d04448d5fd/developer_console_final_1783441709566.png)

### What You See Above
A **hidden, developer-only** error monitoring dashboard — a Matrix-style console that silently captures every application error in the background.

### Features in Detail

#### 🛡️ How It Works
1. **Global Error Interceptors** are embedded in the backend
2. Every API error, database failure, or unhandled exception is **automatically captured**
3. Errors are stored in the database with full context (URL, method, stack trace)
4. **Zero impact on user experience** — guards and managers never see this page

#### 📊 Error Dashboard
| Information Captured | Example |
|---------------------|---------|
| **Error Message** | "Cannot read property 'id' of undefined" |
| **HTTP Method** | POST |
| **URL Path** | /api/payroll/generate |
| **Stack Trace** | Full technical details for debugging |
| **Timestamp** | "2026-07-07 14:32:18" |
| **User** | Which user triggered the error |
| **Status** | Open / Resolved |

#### 🔧 Error Resolution
- Click **"Resolve"** to mark an error as fixed
- Add **notes** for what caused the error and how it was fixed
- Track **error frequency** to identify recurring issues

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This page is **not visible** in the normal navigation sidebar. It's accessed via a special route (`/developer`) — only the agency admin or developer should know this URL.

## Security Architecture

The software implements **enterprise-grade security** suitable for handling sensitive employee and financial data.

### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Password Storage** | bcrypt (12 rounds) | Passwords are cryptographically hashed — impossible to reverse |
| **Session Tokens** | JWT (24-hour expiry) | Stateless authentication with automatic expiry |
| **Secret Management** | Auto-generated 128-char key | Unique secret per installation — stored outside the app |
| **Rate Limiting** | 500 req/15 min | Prevents brute-force and DDoS attacks |

### 🛡️ Data Protection
| Feature | How It Works |
|---------|-------------|
| **Input Validation** | All inputs validated with Joi schemas before processing |
| **SQL Injection Prevention** | Parameterized queries throughout — no raw string concatenation |
| **XSS Protection** | Helmet.js security headers on all responses |
| **Sensitive Data Masking** | Aadhaar, passwords, bank details redacted from all logs |
| **CORS Policy** | Only localhost allowed in production (Electron) |

### 💾 Database Security
- **SQLite** — Self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration
- **Database file** stored in user's AppData folder (not inside the app)
- **Survives updates** — Replacing the `.exe` never touches the database
- **Automatic migrations** — Schema updates applied on startup (supports both SQL and JavaScript migrations)
